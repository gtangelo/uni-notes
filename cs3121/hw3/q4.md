**4. You are on vacation for $N$ days at a resort that has three possible activities 1, 2 and 3. For each day $i$, for each activity 1,2 or 3, you’ve determined how much enjoyment $e(i, j)$ $(1 \le i \le n; 1 ≤ j \le 3)$ you will get out of that activity if you do it on that particular day (the same activity might give you a different amounts of enjoyment at different days). However, you are not allowed to do the same activity two days in a row. Design an algorithm for determining the maximum total enjoyment possible over the entire stay of $N$ days and the sequence of activities you should do at each day. (20 pts)**

We first define the subproblem to solve which is the maximum total enjoyment one can receive up to the day $i$​​​​​​ such that on the $i^{th}$​​​​​​ day, we must complete activity $j$​​​​​​. Let us define a function called $M(i,j)$​​​​​​ that finds the optimal solution in the maximum total enjoyment that one can receive up to day $i$​​​​​​ by performing activity $j$​​​​​​ on the $i^{th}$​​​​​​ day. 

The base case of this solution is $M(1,j) = e(1,j)$​​​ where $j$​​​ is the activity performed since we know that on the first day, we are given that the total enjoyment one can only receive $e(1,j)$​​​​ since one activity is completed.

Since we are bounded that no activity can be performed two days in a row, we can define the recursive solution for $M$ below:
$$
M(i,j)
=
\begin{cases}
  e(i,1) + \max\{M(i - 1, 2), M(i - 1, 3)\} & \text{if $j = 1$} \\
  e(i,2) + \max\{M(i - 1, 1), M(i - 1, 3)\} & \text{if $j = 2$} \\
  e(i,3) + \max\{M(i - 1, 1), M(i - 1, 2)\} & \text{if $j = 3$} \\
\end{cases}
$$

To obtain the maximum total enjoyment possible on day $N$​​, we can find the maximum enjoyment received out of the possibilities in performing activity 1, 2 and 3 on day $N$​​ by considering $opt(N) = \max\{M(N,1), M(N,2), M(N,3)\}$​​​.

To find the sequence of activities, we start from activity $j$​ from $\max\{M(N,1), M(N,2), M(N,3)\}$​ that earns the most enjoyment on the $N^{th}$​​​​​ day​ and backtracking our way from there to give us a sequence of activities. 

Since there are 3 activities to consider over $N$​​ days, the time complexity for this algorithm is $O(3N) = O(N)$​​ because as $N$​​ grows larger, there still exist a constant number of activities to find the maximum enjoyment for.
