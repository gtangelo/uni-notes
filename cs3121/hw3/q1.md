**1. Boolean operators NAND and NOR are defined as follows:**

| NAND    | $true$  | $false$ |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| $true$  | $false$ | $true$  |
| $false$ | $true$  | $true$  |

| NOR     | $true$  | $false$ |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| $true$  | $false$ | $false$ |
| $false$ | $false$ | $true$  |

**You are given a boolean expression consisting of a string of the symbols $true$, $false$, separated by operators AND, OR, NAND and NOR but without any parentheses. Count the number of ways one can put parentheses in the expression such that it will evaluate to $true$. (20 pts)**

Within the given boolean expression, there exist $n$ symbols and $n-1$​ operations between each symbol. We can solve this problem by first defining the subproblems. Our first subproblem is that we need to find how many ways we can place brackets in the expression starting from the $i^{th}$ symbol to the $j^{th}$ symbol evaluate to $true$. Let call this function $T(i, j)$. The next subproblem is to find how many brackets in the expression starting from the $i^{th}$ symbol to the $j^{th}$ symbol evaluate to $false$. Lets call this function $F(i,j)$​​​.​

For each subproblem, we split around an operator $k$ such that everything to the left of $k$ is in its own bracket and everything to the right is in another bracket. This divides the boolean expression into smaller expressions to solve recursively. Thus, we solve each of the subproblems and then combine the results together, applying the function $T(i,j)$ or $F(i,j)$ depending on the operator $k$ that we are splitting the expression and whether if we need the smaller expression to evaluate to $true$ or $false$​​​ based on the operator $k$.

The base case for $T(i,i)$​ returns 1 if symbol $i$​ is $true$​. Otherwise, it returns 0 since the expression is $false$​. Conversely, $F(i,i)$​ returns 1 if the symbol $i$​ is $false$​ and 0 if $true$​​​.
$$
T(i,j)
= \sum\limits_{k=i}^{j-1}
\begin{cases}
  T(i,k) \times T(k+1,j) & \text{if operator $k$ is AND} \\
  T(i,k) \times T(k+1,j) + T(i,k)\times F(k+1,j) + F(i, k) \times T(k + 1, j)  & \text{if operator $k$ is OR} \\
  T(i,k) \times F(k+1,j) + F(i,k)\times T(k+1,j) + F(i, k) \times F(k + 1, j)  & \text{if operator $k$ is NAND} \\
  F(i,k) \times F(k+1,j) & \text{if operator $k$ is NOR} \\
\end{cases}
$$

$$
F(i,j)
= \sum\limits_{k=i}^{j-1}
\begin{cases}
  T(i,k) \times F(k+1,j) + F(i,k) \times T(k+1,j) + F(i,k) \times F(k+1,j) & \text{if operator $k$ is AND} \\
  F(i,k) \times F(k+1,j) & \text{if operator $k$ is OR} \\
  T(i,k) \times T(k+1,j) & \text{if operator $k$ is NAND} \\
  T(i,k) \times T(k+1,j) + T(i,k) \times F(k+1,j) + F(i,k) \times T(k+1,j) & \text{if operator $k$ is NOR} \\
\end{cases}
$$

To obtain the final solution, we apply the recursive function to the problem such that $T(1,n)$​ returns the number of ways one can put parentheses in the expression such that it will evaluate to $true$.

Overall, the complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^3)$​. There are $O(n^2)$​​ subproblems to reclusively solve and $O(n)$​​​​​ different evaluations of these subproblems.
