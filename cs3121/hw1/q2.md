**2. You are given a set of $n$ fractions of the form $x_i/y_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n)$, where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are positive integers. Unfortunately, all values $y_i$ are incorrect; they are all of the form $y_i = c_i+E$ where numbers $c_i ≥ 1$ are the correct values and $E$ is a positive integer (equal for all $y_i$). Fortunately, you are also given a number $S$ which is equal to the correct sum $S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} = x_i/c_i$. Design an algorithm which finds all the correct values of fractions $x_i/c_i$ and which runs in time $O(n\log{\min\{y_i:1 \le i \le n\}})$. (20 points)**

To find the correct values of the fractions $\frac{x_i}{c_i}$​​​​​ for $y_i$​​​​​, we need to determine the value of the constant $E$​​​​​ since $y_i = c_i + E$​​​​​. Since $y_i$​​​​​ and $c_i$​​​​​ must be positive integers, we know that $E$​​​​​ is bounded by $\min{\{y_i:1 \le i \le n\}}.$​​​​​ Thus, $E$​​​​​ is defined as $1 \le E \le \min{\{y_1:1 \le i \le n\}}$​​​​​. We can find the correct values of $y_i$​​​​​ if  we can first find the correct value of $E$​​​​​ since $c_i = y_i - E$​​​​​. To find $E$​​​​​, we can use a binary search starting in the range of $1 \le x \le n$​​​​​. We then find a value for $E$​​​​​ so that we subtract from the sums of the denominators of $y_i$​​​​​. Adding up all the fractions with the denominators $y_i$​​​​​ being subtracted by $E$​​​​​ reveals how close we are to the correct sum $S$​​​​​. If the sum of fractions with the denominators $y_i$​​​​​ does not equal to the sum $S$​​​​​, then we update the binary search to contain the upper or lower half range of values depending on how close the sum of all fractions is to $S$​​​​​ and repeat. Calculating the sums of the denominators of $y_i$​​​​​ in a linear fashion happens in $O(n)$​​​​​. Whilst the binary search occurs in $O(\log{\min\{y_i:1 \le i \le n\}})$​​​​​. Hence, the complexity of the algorithm runs in time $O(n\log{\min\{y_i:1 \le i \le n\}})$​​​​​
