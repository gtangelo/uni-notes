**5. Read about the asymptotic notation in the review material and determine if $f(n) = O(g(n))$ or $g(n) = O(f(n))$ or both (i.e., $f(n) = Θ(g(n))$) or neither of the two, for the following pairs of functions**

**(a) $f(n) = log_2(n); g(n) = \sqrt[10]{n}$; (6 points)**

To prove that $f(n) = O(g(n))$, we must show that $0 \le f(n) \le cg(n)$ where $c \ge 0$. To determine if $f(n) = O(g(n))$ requires us to satisfy the condition where $f(n) \le c*g(n)$ where $c = 1$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $g(n)$ gives us $\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} \le 1$. If $g(n)$ is an asymptotic upper bound for $f(n)$, we must show that $g(n)$ grows substantially faster than $f(n)$ and eventually dominates. As such, we need to find $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)}$ and the limit must be less than $1$ as stated earlier. We can use L'Hopital rule to find the limit as both the numerator and the denominator go to infinity.

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{log_2(n)}{\sqrt[10]{n}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{(log_2(n))'}{(\sqrt[10]{n})'} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\frac{1}{n\ln{2}}}{\frac{1}{10}n^{(-9/10)}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{10}{n^{\frac{1}{10}} \ln{2}} = 0
$$

As we can see, as $n \to \infty$, $\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} \to 0$. Therefore, we know that as $n$ grows larger, $g(n)$ substantially dominates $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ is an asymptotic upper bound for $f(n)$ as $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{log_2(n)}{\sqrt[10]{n}} \le 1$. Thus, we have determined that $f(n) = O(g(n))$.

**(b) $f(n) = n^n$; $g(n) = 2^{n\log_2{n^2}}$; (6 points)**

To prove that $f(n) = O(g(n))$, we must show that $f(n) \le c*g(n)$ where $c = 1$. By using the rule $\log(a^b) = b\log{a}$, we can simplify $g(n)$ such that $g(n) = 2^{n\log_2{n^2}} = 2^{2n\log_2{n}}$. Rearranging the expression gives us:

$$
g(n) = 2^{\log_2{n} \times2n}
$$

Using one of the logarithm identities $x^\frac{\log(a)}{\log(x)} = a$ gives us:

$$
g(n) = 2^{\log_2{n} \times2n} = 2^{\log_2{n} \times2n} = n^{2n}
$$

Thus, $g(n) = n^{2n}$. From this, because $n^{2n}$ grows substantially faster than $n^n$, it is clear that $f(n) \le g(n)$. Hence, $g(n)$ is an asymptotic upper bound for $f(n)$ and that $f(n) = O(g(n))$.

**(c) $f(n) = n^{1+\sin(πn)}$; $g(n) = n$. (8 points)**

It is assumed that $n$ is a natural number. Therefore, the result of $1 + \sin(\pi n)$ would always equal to $1$ as $n$ increases due to it being a periodic function. Hence, $n^{1+\sin(\pi n)} = n^1 = n$ and thus $f(n) =\Theta(g(n))$ as both $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ have the same asymptotic growth rate as proven.
