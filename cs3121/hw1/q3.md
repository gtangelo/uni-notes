**3. You are given an array $A$ consisting of $n$ positive integers, not necessarily all distinct. You are also given $n$ pairs of integers $(L_i , U_i)$ and have to determine for all $1 ≤ i ≤ n$ the number of elements of $A$ which satisfy $L_i ≤ A[m] ≤ U_i$ by an algorithm which runs in time $O(n\log{n})$.

To determine the number of elements of $A$ which satisfies the condition $L_i ≤ A[m] ≤ U_i$, given $n$ pairs of integers $(L_i , U_i)$, we can firstly sort the array $A$ in $O(n\log{n})$ using merge sort. This would allow us to then use a binary search in $O(\log{n})$ to find a value $A[m]$ that satisfies $L_i ≤ A[m] ≤ U_i$. We can perform a binary search to find indices that contains:

- the first element in $A$ no less than $L_i$
- the first element in $A$ strictly greater than $U_i$

However, since it is stated that not all elements in $A$ are distinct, we need to consider cases where we encounter elements that have duplicate values. Thus, we would need to check to see if the preceding element is a duplicate element and continually decrement until the it is smaller than $L_i$. Similarly, we would need to increment until it has reached an element larger than $U_i$. Thus, to find the number of elements of $A$ which satisfy $L_i ≤ A[m] ≤ U_i$, we get the difference between the two indices. A binary search runs in $O(\log{n}) $ however, it is repeated for $n$ pairs of integers. Hence, the algorithm runs in $O(n\log{n})$ overall.
