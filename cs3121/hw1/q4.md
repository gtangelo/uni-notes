**4. You are given an array containing a sequence of $2^n − 1$ consecutive positive integers starting with $1$ except that one number was skipped; thus the sequence is of the form $1, 2, 3, . . . , k−1, k+1, . . . , 2^n$. You have to determine the missing term accessing at most $O(n)$ many elements of $A$. (20 points)**

To find the skipped term $m$ accessing at most $O(n)$ many elements in the sequence of $2^n-1$, we can use a binary search. It is stated that the consecutive numbers in array $A$ are sorted and thus using a binary search will give us the complexity of accessing elements in $A$ at most of $O(\log{n})$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. However, since there are $2^n - 1$ elements in the array, the complexity of accessing elements in $A$ would be $O(\log{2^n - 1})$. In Big-Oh notation, it is assumed that the base of $\log$ is $2$. Thus, by applying this concept, we get the complexity of $O(\log{2^n-1}) = O(\log{2^n}) = O(n\log{2}) = O(n)$ for accessing elements in $A$.

In $A$, elements that appears before the skipped number would satisfy the condition $A[i] - i = 1$ where $i$ is the current index and assuming that $A$ is indexed starting from $0$. On the other hand, elements that appears after the skipped number would satisfy the condition of $A[i] - i = 2$. We can use this condition in our binary search to identify if the element in an index is before or after the skipped number.

To determine what was the skipped number, if the element at 'mid' index in a binary search satisfies the condition of $A[i] - i = 1$, then we know that the skipped number occurs in the other half of the array from 'mid' to 'high'. Otherwise, if the element satisfies the condition of $A[i] - i = 2$, then the skipped number occurs before the 'mid' index. Once identified, we set the new boundaries for 'low' and 'high' for the binary search and continually repeat this until we have found the index after the skipped number. Hence, we would be accessing at most $O(n)$ elements of $A$.
