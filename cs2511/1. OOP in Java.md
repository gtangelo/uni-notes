# Object Orientated Programming in Java

- create user defined types i.e. classes
- each class contains data (attributes) and methods
- instance of a class is called an **object**
- encapsulates data (attributes) and methods (behaviours) into objects
- Objects have the property of information hiding

## Inheritance

- software reusability - new classes (the subclass) are created from the existing classes (the superclass) by absorbing their attributes and behaviours which they can be modify.

## Relationships

 ### Is-a Inheritance Relationship

- In an "is-a" relationship, an object of a subclass may also be treated as an object of the superclass. i.e. `UndergraduateStudent` can be treated as `Student`.
- Should use inheritance to model as a "is-a" relationship. Donâ€™t use inheritance **unless all or most inherited attributes and	methods make sense**.

### Has-a relationship

- In a "has-a" relationship, a **class object has an object of another class** to store its state or do its work, i.e. it "has-a" reference to that other object.
- "Has-a" relationships are examples of creating new classes by composition of existing classes

## Designing a Class

- keep data private
- consider different ways an object can be created
- always initialise data
- if object is no longer in use, free up all associated resources
- break up classes with too many responsibility
- Classes are often related. Factor out common attributes and methods into a new class. Then, use a 'is-a' or 'has-a' relationships.

### Classes/Objects in Java

**Access Modifiers**

- **Private** - only avaliable in the class, not avaliable in the subclass
- **Protected** - availiable in the class, subclass, package or in other packages
- **Public** - availiable everywhere
- No modifer (Default) - access only in the package

**Keywords**

- **static** - associated to the class, not to the object
  - Using a static method, would not need to create an object/instance to use the method.
  - Otherwise, without `static`, you would need to create an instance to access that method.
- **final** - defined as a constant

**Classes**

- Every class is a subclass to the `Object` class -> `Object` class offers default methods i.e. `this.toString()`

```java
public class Circle {
    static int no_circle = 0;
    public Circle {
        super();		// calls constructor of the super class - constructs class 'Object' instance
        				// 	- java implicitly executes this, so do not need to write
        no_circle++;	// keeps track how many circles were initialised due to 'static' keyword
    }
    public Circle(int x, int y, int r) {
        this();			// initialises the first constructor 'Circle()'
        ...
    }
    public Circle(int x, int y) {
        this(x, y, 5);	// initialises the first constructor 'Circle()'
    }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        ...				// overrides toString method from superclass i.e. class 'Object'
    }
    
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
   
        if(obj == null) { return false; }
        if(obj == this) { return true; }

        if(this.getClass() != obj.getClass()){
            return false;
        }

        Circle other = (Circle) obj;
        if(this.x == other.x && this.y == other.y && this.r == other.r){
            return true;
        }
        else {
            return false;
        }
         
    }
}
```
