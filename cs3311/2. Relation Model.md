# Relation Model

## Relational Data Model

Relational data model: a collection of inter-connected relations (or tables) using the relations structuring mechanism. Relations are used to model both entities and relationships.

- Each **relation** (denoted $R,S,T,...$) has:
  - a name  (unique within a given database)
  - a set of attributes  (which can be viewed as column headings)
- Each **attribute** (denoted $A,B,...$ or $a_1,a_2,...$) has:
  - a name  (unique within a given relation)
  - an associated domain  (set of allowed values)
- Consider relation $R$ with attributes $a_1, a_2, ... a_n$ and $D_i$ for the domain:

  - Relation schema of $R: R(a_1:D_1, a_2:D_2, ... a_n:D_n)$
  - Tuple of $R$ : an element of $D_1 × D_2 × ... × D_n$   (i.e. list of values)
  - Instance of $R$ : subset of $D_1 × D_2 × ... × D_n$   (i.e. set of tuples)
  - Note:   tuples: (2,3)  ≠  (3,2)     relation: { (a,b), (c,d) }  =  { (c,d), (a,b) }
- Domains are comprised of atomic values   (e.g. integer, string, boolean, date)
- A distinguished value `NULL` belongs to all domains
- A database is a collection of associated relations. Each relation has a key   (subset of attributes unique for each tuple)
